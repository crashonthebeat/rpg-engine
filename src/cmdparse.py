# This is the command parser. It takes a user input and then divides that
# input into three basic elements: the verb (primary action), the direct 
# object (the recipient of the action), and the indirect object (the 
# recipient of the object). 
# 
# For those who slept through grammar class, in the command "drop sword", 
# drop is the verb, and sword is the direct object, as the sword is what
# you are dropping. In the command, "take sword from stone", "take" is 
# the action, the sword is what you are "taking", and the stone is the 
# indirect object, indicating that is where you are taking the sword from.
# This indirect object is typically after a preposition. 
# 
# This will be explained to players in the help file.
